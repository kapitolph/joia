<h3 align="center"><strong>A lightweight ChatGPT alternative designed for team collaboration</strong></h3>

[Joia](https://joia.so/) is an open source alternative to _[ChatGPT for Teams](https://openai.com/chatgpt/team)_, designed from the ground up for collaboration.

The easiest way to get started with Joia is by creating a [Joia Cloud account](https://joia.so/). If you prefer to self-host Joia, please refer to our documentation below.

## Main features & benefits

- Efortlessly grant **people access** to a user-friendly AI Chat.
- Use any LLM, including the **latest open source LLMs** like Llama 2, Mixtral and others (more coming soon).
- Create **collaborative chatbots** for specific use cases, and share them across your teams.
- **Save between of 50% and 75%** (depends on usage) compared to _ChatGPT for Teams_ and _ChatGPT Enterprise_.
- **Get responses 40% faster** than ChatGPT Plus. The OpenAI API is generally faster.
- **Prevent your prompts from being used for training purposes**. When using ChatGPT Plus, your data might then be used for training purposes. However, when connecting to OpenAI via API keys, you're guaranteed that any inputs provided won't be used.

## Getting started

#### Cloud

The easiest way to get started with Joia is with [our official managed service in the cloud](https://joia.so/). At the moment it is completely free to use without limits, although we have plans to introduce a pricing model in the future.

In the cloud version you can either use your own API keys for LLM provider, or purchase credits with us.

Our cloud version can save a substantial amount of developer time and resources. We think it's the de-facto solution for most customers and the one which provides most value for mone. Plus, any future revenues will go towards the funding and maintenance of Joia. Youâ€™ll be supporting open source software and getting a great service!

#### Vercel

To deploy on Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Create a project by clicking on **Add New... > Project**.
2. Select **Import Third-Party Git Repository** and enter the URL of this repository.
3. Insert the environment variables. To do so, use `.env.example` as a reference for the variables to fill in. You'll need to set the `DATABASE_URL` variable to point to your Postgres database, which you can provision with Vercel.
4. Deploy the project.
5. Set up your domain to point to the Vercel deployment.

#### Fully self-hosted

To self host a Joia app you'll need to follow the next steps:

1. Provision a Postgres database. The details may vary based on your stup.
2. Clone or copy this repository.
3. Create an `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file. You'll need to set the `DATABASE_URL` variable to point to your Postgres database.
4. Install the dependencies by running `yarn install`.
5. Build the NextJS app by running `yarn production:build`. This will prepare NextJS to be built and run the build itself.
6. Run a post-install script by running `yarn production:postbuild`. This script will run the migrations.
7. Bootstrap the app by running `yarn production:start`.
